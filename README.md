The code will be updated again once it is complete & clean.
Data provided in the excel file is purely fictional. For now, it covers most of the quantitative metrics for [SASB Standards for e-commerce businesses](http://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CN0404_E-Commerce_Standard.pdf?hsCtaTracking=22783197-994b-44dd-ba3c-75ccecfdf855%7C421b053f-4bc2-4221-a6ac-065600d3b873).
